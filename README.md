# My First Python Project

This is my first Python project. This project is a simple fortune teller that generates a random fortune and a lucky number. It's a fun and engaging way to start learning Python and get a taste of programming logic and randomness.

## How it works
The project uses Python's random module to generate:
- A lucky number between 1 and 100
- A fortune message from three possible outcomes

## Why I Created This Project
I wanted to create a simple yet interesting project to dive into Python programming. I learned about this project on LinkedIn, which has been an invaluable resource for my learning journey. This fortune teller project is a great way to learn about:
- Random number generation
- Conditional statements
- String formatting
